            talents is at the heart of a fairer society. Yet in country after country it is wealth, not talent,
            that dictates a child’s educational destiny.… This reality is failing individual children,
            each of whom has a right to education. It is also failing society,
              
            as a generation of talented poor girls and boys cannot fulfil their promise and contribute fully to human progress.
            Brilliant doctors, teachers or entrepreneurs are instead herding goats or collecting water.
            Humanity faces unprecedented challenges. Yet instead of utilizing the talents of all of people,
            inequality means we are squandering this potential</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Understanding the Numbers: Good News and Bad</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">More people in the world today are educated than ever before. 
            In 1820 only 12% of the people in the world could read and write. 
            Today the share is reversed: only 17% of the world’s population remains illiterate. Primary school enrollment is 
            now almost universal in most countries, with as many girls enrolling as boys.

            Nevertheless, these figures overshadow the impact of persistent inequity. Some 63 million children 
            of primary school age were out of school in 2016 and progress on primary school enrollment remains flat. 
            Most impacted are the world’s poorest countries, where the lack of basic education is a hard constraint on development. 
            In Niger, for example, just 36.5% of 15- to 20-year-olds are literate.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Achieving greater equality between women and men and increased empowerment of 
            women and girls has long been recognized as a global imperative for development. In 2015 it was made a
             stand-alone goal in the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 
             Education is key to meeting that goal, and there has been real progress. Globally, 90% of girls now complete primary school,
              but only 75% complete their lower secondary education. In low income countries, the situation is less encouraging: 
              fewer than 67% of girls complete their primary education, and only 33% completes lower secondary school.
               Income and gender combine for a crushing result. According to Oxfam, in Kenya, 
               a girl from a poor family has a one in 250 chance of pursuing her studies beyond secondary school,
                compared to a one in three chance for a boy from a rich family..</p>
